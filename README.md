# agrimji is a Swahili word for Urban Farming
## 1. The Challenge
  1.1 Existing method of growing and transporting plant-based food is toxic to the environment, unhealthy, and produces a lot of waste.
  1.2 Fertilizer Pollution
  1.3 Risk of blight
  1.4 risks of poisoning

## 2. The Solution
  2.1 Urban Farming offers local produce grown in carefully balanced environments
    2.1.1 Reduces environmental toxicity by eliminating transportation emissions
    2.1.2 Reduced pesticide use and need for commercially-grown crops, which often have reduced nutritional properties
    2.1.3 Reduced waste due to "JIT" supply chain (grow it & immediately eat it) and a stronger psychological connection to the supply chain.

## 3. The Technology
  3.1 Aeroponics
    3.1.1 One of the most popular solutions for vertical farming
    3.1.2 Less water-intensive
    3.1.3 High maintenance (minerals clog up machinery)

  3.2 Hydroponics
    3.2.1 More water-intensive
    3.2.2 Lower maintenance

  3.3 Aquaponics
    3.3.1 Fish provide fertilizer for plant nutrients
    3.3.2 Closed ecological system (permaculture)
    3.3.3 Most sustainable solution
    3.3.4 Low maintenance

  3.4 Types of Plants
    3.4.1 Energy savers
      3.4.1.1 Solar absorption
      3.4.1.2 Cooling
        3.4.1.2.1 Insulation
    3.4.2 Food producers
    3.4.3 Air Filters
    3.4.4 Water Filters

  3.5 Living Buildings

    4.2.2 Rice
    4.2.3 Salad

  4.3 Excess space
    4.3.1 reduces aesthetic need

  4.5 geometrics
  4.6 lead points
    4.6.1 green building council of america
    4.6.2 boma

  4.7 3d print
  4.8 rotating wall
  4.9 air quality
    4.9.1 smog = C02

  4.10 food sharing apps
    4.10.1 barter vs. money exchange
    4.10.2 bag program

  4.11 watson chef
    4.11.1 building-wide dietary needs

  4.12 quality control
    4.12.1 uber

  4.13 consumer
    4.13.1 aesthetics
    4.13.2 non-aesthetics

# GOAL OF THIS APP
## Intensive Farming
1. Weakness
  1.1 High capital initial and maintenance cost
    1.1.1 high expenses in build and maintenance cost

    1.2.1 manure management
  1.3 Animal Rights
    1.3.1 beef production industry have to deal with allegations and protests by animal rights advocates
  1.4 Need skillful workers
  1.5 heavy deforestations

2. Opportunity
  2.1 can attract investor
  2.2 agrotourism park can be built
  2.3 high income production
  2.4 no local competitors
  2.5 can create franchise
  2.6 easy to produce new breed

3. Threats
  3.1 need long-term financial sources
  3.2 high expenses
  3.3 disease outbreak
  3.4 high international competitor
  3.5 price of local meat higher than the imported meat
  3.6 rate of return for expenses slow
    3.6.1 investors need fast rate of return
  3.7 weather

4. Problems
  4.1 Diseased animals
  4.2 Missing animals
  4.3 Animals were not separated by different genders and ages
  4.4 Unsystematic system management
  4.5 Feeding ratio were not uniform
  4.6 Inbreeding problems
  4.7 Livestock waste causing environmental pollution
  4.8 Huge land usage
  4.9 Animal production were not in maximum production
  4.10 Demand for animal production keep increasing

5. Strengths
  5.1 high-yield farming
  5.2 Inbreeding control
  5.3 Reduce pollution to the environment
  5.4 protection of livestock
    5.4.1 farmer easily supervise and monitor the land and protect his livestock from being hurt or hounded by dangerous wild animals
