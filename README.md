# agrimji is a Swahili word for Urban Farming
## 1. The Challenge
  1.1 Existing method of growing and transporting plant-based food is toxic to the environment, unhealthy, and produces a lot of waste.
  1.2 Fertilizer Pollution
  1.3 Risk of blight
  1.4 risks of poisoning

## 2. The Solution
  2.1 Urban Farming offers local produce grown in carefully balanced environments
    2.1.1 Reduces environmental toxicity by eliminating transportation emissions
    2.1.2 Reduced pesticide use and need for commercially-grown crops, which often have reduced nutritional properties
    2.1.3 Reduced waste due to "JIT" supply chain (grow it & immediately eat it) and a stronger psychological connection to the supply chain.

## 3. The Technology
  3.1 Aeroponics
    3.1.1 One of the most popular solutions for vertical farming
    3.1.2 Less water-intensive
    3.1.3 High maintenance (minerals clog up machinery)

  3.2 Hydroponics
    3.2.1 More water-intensive
    3.2.2 Lower maintenance

  3.3 Aquaponics
    3.3.1 Fish provide fertilizer for plant nutrients
    3.3.2 Closed ecological system (permaculture)
    3.3.3 Most sustainable solution
    3.3.4 Low maintenance

  3.4 Types of Plants
    3.4.1 Energy savers
      3.4.1.1 Solar absorption
      3.4.1.2 Cooling
        3.4.1.2.1 Insulation
    3.4.2 Food producers
    3.4.3 Air Filters
    3.4.4 Water Filters

  3.5 Living Buildings

## 4. Opportunities
  4.1 Types of Plants

    4.6.2 boma

  4.7 3d print
  4.8 rotating wall
  4.9 air quality
    4.9.1 smog = C02

  4.10 food sharing apps
    4.10.1 barter vs. money exchange
    4.10.2 bag program

  4.11 watson chef
    4.11.1 building-wide dietary needs
